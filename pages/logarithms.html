      Logarithm Rules and Properties
    </h3>
    <!-- intro -->
    <p>You're familiar with exponents, which are used to raise a value to a power.
      Logarithms go along with exponents. The easiest way to think about them is that they "undo"
      an exponent. When we take the logarithm of a number <em>x</em>, we get the number to which we raise the base <em>b</em>
      to get the number <em>x</em>. Logarithms have some specific properties that we'll go 
      over here!

    <!--explanation-->
    <p>As you can see in the table above, there are 5 main properties of logarithms. We will cover the product rule 
      here, and let you use the table to figure out the rest. <br> As shown in the table, we start with the log base <em>a</em> 
      of some number <em>x</em> multiplied by some number <em>y</em>. Unlike normal multiplication, 
      the product rule of a logarithm says that we split the logarithm into two seperate logarithms 
      and take the log of <em>x</em> and the log of <em>y</em>. This creates a much simpler set of expressions, and we
      can more easily solve for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.
    </p>

    <!--example problem-->
    <h4>Example 1</h4>
    <p>Use the properites in the table to simplify the expression: log_r((a/b)c)</p>
    <h4><em>Solution</em></h4>
    <p>With this expression, we start by applying the product rule to <em>(a/b)c</em>. We can split 
    <em>(a/b)</em> from <em>c</em> and have two seperate logarithms. From there, we can 
    apply the quotient rule to split up <em>a/b</em> into the subtracting of two logarithms.
    Nice work!</p>
