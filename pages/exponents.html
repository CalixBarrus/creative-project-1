      Exponent Rules and Properties
    </h3>
    <!-- intro -->
    <p>Exponents are important! You'll see them more and more as you advance
    further into upper level math classes. It is important that you feel comfortable
    manipulating them.</p>

    <!--explanation-->
    <p>There are 8 important exponent properties that will come in handy, here
    we will cover only the first 3. </p>

    <h4>Product Rule</h4>
    <p>The product rule states that given the product of two expressions to some
      power with the same base, they can be comvined into one expression by taking
      the same base the power which is the sum of the first two powers. To illustrate,
      given two expressions a^x * a^y, we can note that these two have the same base.
      We can sum x + y and by the product rule know that a^x * a^y = a^(x+y).
    </p>
    <p> This makes sense intuitively. Consider the example of a^2 * a^3. We know
      That exponents are just some base multiplied against itself a number of times,
      so this expression is equivalent to a^2 * a^3 = (a * a * a) * (a * a). Now,
      since multiplacation is associative this is the same as a * a * a * a * a =
      a^5.
    </p>

    <h4>Example 1</h4>
    Simplify b^3 * b^7
    <h4><em>Solution</em></h4>
    <p>By the product rule, we can simply sum 3 + 7 = 10. Since both terms have the same base,
      we know that we can simplify to b^(3 + 7) = b^10.
    </p>

    <h4>Quotient Rule</h4>
    <p> The quotient rule is analogous to the product rule. It states that,
      a quotient of two terms with the same base can be simplified to one term having
      the same base to the power that is the difference of the exponenets of the
      first two terms.
    </p>
    <p> Thinking through an example we find that this makes sense. Consider a^3 / a^2.
      Exponents are simply a repeated product of the given base, so the example can
      be rewritten as (a * a * a)/(a * a). By the associative property of multiplacation
      and division, this can be rewritten as (a / a) * (a / a) * a = (1) * (1) * a = a.
      Where a = a^(3-2), as expected.
    </p>

    <h4>Example 2</h4>
    Simplify b^3 / b^7
    <h4><em>Solution</em></h4>
    <p>By the quotient rule, we can take the difference 3 - 7 = -4. Since both terms have the same base,
      we know that we can simplify to b^(3 - 7) = b^(-4).
    </p>

    <h4>Power Rule</h4>
    <p>The power rule states that a base to a power to an additional power is equivalent
      to that same base to the the product of both powers. Consider (a^2)^3. Applying
      what we already know about exponents, this is the same as (a^2)*(a^2)*(a^2)
      = (a * a) * (a * a) * (a * a) = a^6 for a grand total of 6 = 2 * 3 a's.
    </p>

    <h4>Example 3</h4>
    Simplify (b^3)^(-7)
    <h4><em>Solution</em></h4>
    <p>By the power rule, we can take the product 3 * -7 = -21. Since both terms have the same base,
      we know that we can simplify to b^(3 * -7) = b^(-21).
    </p>
